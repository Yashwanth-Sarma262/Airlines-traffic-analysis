This project presents a detailed analysis of U.S. airline traffic data spanning from 2003 to 2023. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information such as flight routes, airline carriers, passenger volumes, travel distances, and average fares. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about air travel trends over two decades using data visualization and statistical analysis.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

Seaborn & Matplotlib for statistical data visualization

Plotly Express for interactive plots

Google Colab as the development environment

Key Methodologies & Analysis Performed

Data Cleaning: Removed missing or inconsistent values and formatted date/time features for easier time-based grouping.

Passenger Trends: A monthly line plot showed the seasonal nature of air travel, with peaks during holiday seasons and consistent yearly growth.

Airline Market Share: Bar plots highlighted dominant carriers such as Southwest, Delta, and American Airlines, with changing market dynamics over the years.

Top Destinations: Visualization of the most frequently visited cities revealed hubs like Atlanta, Chicago, and Denver as major air traffic centers.

Fare Distribution & Trends: Fare analysis across quarters showed fluctuations influenced by seasonal demand and airline pricing strategies.

Flight Distance Patterns: Averages of nonstop miles over quarters indicated relative stability in domestic route lengths.

Key Insights

Passenger volumes have steadily increased post-2003, reflecting rising air travel demand.

A few major carriers maintain strong dominance, though competition from low-cost airlines remains impactful.

Travel behavior shows strong seasonality, with evident spikes during summer and end-of-year holidays.

Fares do not always scale linearly with distance, suggesting strategic pricing across routes.

Top cities handle a significant share of overall U.S. air traffic, emphasizing the importance of major airport hubs.
